# Microservices Potential Improvements

## Current Microservice Overview

1. **Authentication**: Manages user login, sign-up, and session handling.
2. **Inputting Transactions**: Handles user-submitted transaction data.
3. **Displaying Wallet**: Fetches and displays portfolio details.
4. **Storage (DB)**: Centralized data storage for transactions, user data, and possible historical valuations.
5. **Valuation**: Fetches current market prices and asset valuations.
6. **Computation**: Calculates portfolio metrics, aggregation data, and provides computed results to the front-end.

## Potential Improvements & Considerations

1. Decoupling and Scalability

- **Authentication Service**: This service is often a good candidate for separation due to its specific security requirements. If you anticipate future integrations with other services (e.g., OAuth, multi-factor authentication), keeping it isolated is beneficial. However, one could consider using an off-the-shelf service like **Auth0** or **Firebase Authentication** to offload the complexity.
- **Computation Service**: Depending on the complexity of calculations, consider splitting this into two services:
  - **Real-tim Computation**: Handles on-the-fly calculations for immediate user interactions.
  - **Batch Computation**: Periodically processes historical data or large data sets, optimizing for heavy workloads without affecting real-time performance.

2. Event-Driven Architecture

- **Event Sourcing**: Consider adopting an event-driven architecture for better scalability and decoupling. For instance, when a user inputs a transaction, an even can be published to a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ). The **Computation**, **Valuation**, and **Displaying Wallet** services can then subscribe to these events and process data asynchronously, reducing direct dependencies.
- **Audit and History**: Events can also help maintain a historical record of transactions and computations, useful for audit trails and time-series analysis.

3. API Gateway

- **Unified API Layer**: Implementing and API Gateway could simplify front-end interactions by providing a single entry point for the different services. This can handle routing, load balancing, and even aggregate data from multiple services before sending it to the client. It also abstracts the internal microservice structure, allowing for easier changes and scaling.

4. Service Mesh

- **Communication Management**: As the microservices grow, managing service-to-service communication, security, and monitory becomes more complex. A service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) can help manage this complexity by providing a dedicated layer for handling inter-service communications, security policies, and observability.

5. Data Storage Strategy

- **Database Per Service**: Consider whether each service should have its own dedicated database. While this increases isolation and reduces the risk of shared resource bottlenecks, it may add complexity in terms of data consistency. Implementing patterns like **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** can help manage this by separating read and write operations.

6. Caching Layer

- **Improving Performance**: Introducing a caching layer for frequently accessed data (like valuation data) could improve performance and reduce load on the valuation and computation services.

## When Redesign Might Be Necessary

- **Performance Bottlenecks**: If certain services are overwhelmed with requests or data processing tasks, consider splitting them or optimizing their architecture.
- **Complex Interdependencies**: If services are becoming too dependent on each other, leading to tight coupling, redesigning to further decouple and implement asynchronous processing may be beneficial.
- **Future Expansion**: If a significant growth in users or additional features (like advanced analytics, third-party integrations) is anticipated, ensuring that the architecture can scale easily without needing extensive rewrites, however, one way or another rewrites will happen.

## Conclusion

The current microservices design is solid, focusing on clear separation between concerns. Redesigning isn't strictly necessary, but strategic improvements, such as implementing an event-driven architecture, using an API Gateway, or adopting a service mesh, could enhance scalability, performance and maintainability.

It's important to balance the complexity of the architecture with the actual needs of the project. If the current design meets the needs and is manageable, it can always be evolved incrementally as the project grows.
