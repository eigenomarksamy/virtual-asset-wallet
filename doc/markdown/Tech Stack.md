# Tech Stack

## 1. Front-End Development

### Technologies: React.js, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, D3.js

- **React.js**:
  - **Purpose**: Building the user interface for the web application.
  - **Why**: React is a popular JavaScript library that allows you to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. It's well-suited for sing-page applications (SPAs).
- **JavaScript**:
  - **Purpose**: Core language for front-end development.
  - **Why**: JavaScript is essential for client-side scripting, enabling interactive elements within React.js framework.
- **Tailwind CSS**:
  - **Purpose**: Styling application.
  - **Why**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom design quickly without leaving the HTML. It's efficient and helps maintain consistent styling.
- **D3.js** (or **Chart.js**):
  - **Purpose**: Creating interactive charts and graphs for portfolio visualization.
  - **Why**: D3.js is a powerful library for creating complex data visualizations. It's more flexible but requires a steeper learning curve. Chart.js is an alternative if the charts are needed with less code.

### Additional Tools

- **Wireframing**:
  - **Figma** or **Adobe XD** for designing UI/UX wireframes before development. These tools help visualize the user interface and user journey, ensuring that the design is user-friendly.

## 2. Back-End Development (API and Microservices)

### Technologies: Node.js, Express.js, Python, Go, Java, Rust, C++

- **Node.js** + **Express.js**:
  - **Purpose**: Building the API Gateway and some microservices.
  - **Why**: Node.js is excellent for building fast, scalable APIs, especially when using JavaScript across the stack (full-stack JavaScript). Express.js is just a minimalist framework for Node.js, ideal for creating robust APIs.
- **Python**:
  - **Purpose**: Computation Services (financial calculations, analytics).
  - **Why**: Python is strong in data analysis, machine learning, and numerical computations. It’s also great for rapid prototyping.
- **Go**:
  - **Purpose**: Valuation Service or high-performance, lightweight services.
  - **Why**: Go is a statically typed, compiled language designed for efficiency and concurrency, making it excellent for services that require high performance and scalability.
- **Java**:
  - **Purpose**: Authentication Service or other business-critical services.
  - **Why**: Java is robust, widely used in enterprise applications, and offers strong security features. It’s a good choice for critical services like authentication.
- **Rust**:
  - **Purpose**: Performance-critical components like caching layers or low-level data processing services.
  - **Why**: Rust is known for its memory safety and performance, making it suitable for systems programming or components that need to be extremely reliable and fast.
- **C++**:
  - **Purpose**: Performance-critical parts of the system where low-level control is necessary.
  - **Why**: C++ provides granular control over system resources, making it suitable for high-performance computation or real-time processing tasks.

## 3. Database and Storage

### Technologies: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis

- **PostgreSQL**:
  - **Purpose**: Relational database for transaction storage, user data, and financial records.
  - **Why**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database that supports complex queries and transactions, making it suitable for storing structured financial data.
- **MongoDB**:
  - **Purpose**: Storing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as user activity logs, or for services that require flexibility in data models.
  - **Why**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers flexibility in storing and retrieving data without the need for a predefined schema.
- **Redis**:
  - **Purpose**: Caching layer for speeding up data retrieval, session management, and real-time updates.
  - **Why**: Redis is an in-memory data store that can be used for caching frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the database and speeding up response times.

## 4. Deployment and Infrastructure

### Technologies: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP, Terraform

- **Docker**:
  - **Purpose**: Containerizing the microservices.
  - **Why**: Docker allows you to package your application with all its dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Kubernetes**:
  - **Purpose**: Orchestrating Docker containers across a cluster of machines.
  - **Why**: Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers, making it easier to handle a complex microservices architecture.
- **AWS/GCP**:
  - **Purpose**: Cloud infrastructure for hosting your application.
  - **Why**: AWS and GCP are leading cloud platforms that provide robust services for deploying, scaling, and managing applications. You can use services like EC2, RDS, or GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine).
- **Terraform**:
  - **Purpose**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate the provisioning of infrastructure.
  - **Why**: Terraform allows you to define and manage your infrastructure in a versioned, reproducible way, making it easier to deploy and manage resources across multiple environments.

## 5. DevOps and CI/CD

### Technologies: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana

- **Jenkins or GitHub Actions**:
  - **Purpose**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
  - **Why**: Jenkins is a widely-used automation server for building, testing, and deploying applications. GitHub Actions integrates directly with GitHub and is excellent for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Prometheus + Grafana**:
  - **Purpose**: Monitoring and logging.
  - **Why**: Prometheus is used for collecting and querying metrics, while Grafana visualizes this data in dashboards. They’re crucial for monitoring the health of your services in real-time.

## 6. Security

### Technologies: OAuth2, JWT, SSL/TLS, HashiCorp Vault

- **OAuth2 and JWT**:
  - **Purpose**: User authentication and authorization.
  - **Why**: OAuth2 is a widely adopted protocol for authorization, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims securely between two parties.
- **SSL/TLS**:
  - **Purpose**: Secure communication between services and with clients.
  - **Why**: SSL/TLS ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.
- **HashiCorp Vault**:
  - **Purpose**: Managing secrets and sensitive data.
  - **Why**: Vault securely stores and manages access to tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys.

## 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Technologies: Jest, Mocha, Selenium, Postman

- **Jest and Mocha**:
  - **Purpose**: Unit testing for front-end and back-end JavaScript.
  - **Why**: Jest and Mocha are popular testing frameworks that help ensure your code behaves as expected, with support for unit and integration testing.
- **Selenium**:
  - **Purpose**: End-to-end testing for web applications.
  - **Why**: Selenium automates web browsers, allowing you to simulate user interactions and test the entire flow of your application.
- **Postman**:
  - **Purpose**: API testing.
  - **Why**: Postman allows you to create, test, and document APIs, making it easier to ensure that your back-end services are functioning correctly.

## 8. Documentation

### Technologies: Swagger, Sphinx, MkDocs

- **Swagger**:
  - **Purpose**: API documentation.
  - **Why**: Swagger/OpenAPI allows you to generate interactive API documentation that developers can use to understand and interact with your API.
- **Sphinx** or **MkDocs**:
  - **Purpose**: General project documentation.
  - **Why**: Sphinx (often used with Python) and MkDocs (Markdown-based) are tools for creating project documentation, making it easier for developers and users to understand the project.
