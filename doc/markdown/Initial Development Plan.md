# Initial Development Plan

## 1. Define the Project Scope and Objectives

- **Objective**: Clearly outline what are the achievements targeted by this project.
  - Example: "Develop a virtual asset wallet that allows users to manually input transactions, view their portfolio, and track the real-time value of their investments."
- **Key Features**:
  - User authentication and registration
  - Manual transaction input (buying, selling, transferring assets)
  - Portfolio visualization (graphs, tables)
  - Real-time valuations of assets
  - Secure storage of data
- **Non-Objectives**: List what is explicitly out of scope to keep the project focused.
  - Example: "Integration with external financial APIs will be considered in a future phase."

## 2. High-Level Technical Design

- **Architecture**: Decide on the overall architecture (microservices).
- **Technology Stack**:
  - **Front-End**: React.js for UI, possibly Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - **Back-End**: Node.js (Express) for API services, Python for computation, MongoDB or PostgreSQL for databases.
  - **Infrastructure**: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, AWS/GCP for cloud deployment.
- **APIs and Communication**:
  - RESTful APIs for communication between services.
  - JSON as the data format.
  - Message Queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) for event-driven architecture.

## 3. Milestone-Based Development Plan

*This section will be completely moved to a separate Gantt Chart*

### Milestone 1: Project Setup and Basic Infrastructure

- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up version control (GitHub/GitLab).
  - Set up project management tools (Jira, Trello).
  - Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
  - Create Docker containers for each microservice.
  - Set up a basic API Gateway and Service Mesh (optional at this stage).
- **Deliverable**:
  - Initial repository with project structure.
  - Basic deployment pipeline with Docker containers.

### Milestone 2: User Authentication and Authorization

- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement user registration and login in the Authentication Service.
  - Set up JWT-based authentication.
  - Create the front-end components for login and registration.
  - Implement basic access control for other services.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Fully functional Authentication Service.
  - Front-end login/registration pages connected to the back-end.

### Milestone 3: Transaction Input Service

- **Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Design the database schema for storing transactions.
  - Implement the transaction input API in the Transaction Service.
  - Create a form in the front-end for users to input transactions.
  - Implement basic validation and error handling.
  - Ensure that transactions trigger events in the message queue.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Transaction input form on the front-end.
  - Fully functional Transaction Service with data storage.

### Milestone 4: Portfolio Display Service

- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Design the portfolio view in the front-end (graphs, tables).
  - Implement the API for fetching portfolio data from the Displaying Wallet Service.
  - Connect the portfolio display to the real-time valuation service.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Interactive portfolio display in the front-end.
  - API for fetching and displaying user portfolio data.

### Milestone 5: Valuation Service

- **Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up the Valuation Service to fetch market data (initially mock data).
  - Implement real-time valuation updates and integrate with the portfolio display.
  - Optimize the service for performance (caching, asynchronous updates).
- **Deliverables**:
  - Valuation Service providing real-time market data.
  - Portfolio display updating with real-time values.

### Milestone 6: Computation and Analytics

- **Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement key financial computations (e.g., portfolio performance, risk analysis).
  - Integrate the Computation Service with the other services (Input, Display).
  - Add advanced analytics features if desired.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Computation Service with key financial metrics.
  - Integrated analytics features in the portfolio display.

### Milestone 7: Testing, Optimization, and Deployment

- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
  - Perform load testing and optimize the services.
  - Set up monitoring and logging for production.
  - Deploy the application to a cloud provider.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Fully tested and optimized application.
  - Deployed application accessible to users.

## 4. Team Roles and Responsibilities
- **Project Manager**: Oversees the project timeline, manages milestones, and ensures communication between team members.
- **Front-End Developer**: Responsible for UI/UX design, front-end development, and integration with the back-end.
- **Back-End Developer**: Focus on API development, microservices, database design, and integration.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Manages CI/CD pipelines, containerization, deployment, and cloud infrastructure.
- **QA Engineer**: Handles testing strategies, writes automated tests, and ensures product quality.
- **Systems, Networks and Security Engineer**: Focuses on optimizing the network performance and scalability of the system.
- **Data Engineer**: For expansion of features.

## 5. Risk Management

- **Potential Risks**:
  - Scope creep: Mitigate by keeping the project focused and sticking to the defined milestones.
  - Technical challenges: Regular code reviews and technical discussions can help identify and resolve issues early.
  - Resource availability: Have backup plans for critical roles.
- **Contingencies**:
  - Prioritize features to ensure that the core functionality is delivered even if timelines slip.
  - Allocate buffer time in the project timeline to account for unexpected challenges.

## 6. Documentation and Communication

- **Documentation**:
  - Technical documentation for APIs, data models, and architecture.
  - User documentation for how to use the wallet (could be a simple guide or help section).
- **Communication**:
  - Regular team meetings (daily stand-ups, weekly syncs).
  - Use collaboration tools (e.g., Slack) for ongoing communication.

## 7. Continuous Improvement

- **Feedback Loops**: Regularly gather feedback from users and team members to iterate on the product.
- **Post-MVP Enhancements**: Identify features or improvements to work on after the initial release, based on user feedback and performance data.
