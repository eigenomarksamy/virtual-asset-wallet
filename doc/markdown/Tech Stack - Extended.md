# Tech Stack - Extended

## Enhanced System Design

### 1. API Gateway

**Purpose**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.
- **Technology**:
  - **Kong** or **AWS API Gateway**: For managing and routing API requests, rate limiting, logging, and securing communication.
  - **Why**: An API Gateway helps centralize API management, simplifying client interactions with your backend services while adding a layer of security and monitoring.
- **Integration**:
  - All client requests (web, mobile) pass through the API Gateway.
  - **Features**: Request routing, authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.

### 2. Load Balancing

**Purpose**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of microservices to ensure high availability and reliability.
- **Technology**:
  - **Nginx** or **HAProxy** for load balancing.
  - **Kubernetes Ingress**: If deploying in Kubernetes, it provides load balancing within the cluster.
- **Integration**:
  - Microservices are deployed in multiple instances to handle high traffic.
  - Load balancers distribute the requests evenly across these instances, ensuring that no single service is overwhelmed.

### 3. Service Mesh

**Purpose**: Manage service-to-service communication, security, and observability within your microservices architecture.
- **Technology**:
  - **Istio** or **Linkerd** for service mesh.
  - **Why**: A service mesh provides consistent and secure communication between microservices, with features like load balancing, service discovery, retries, and circuit breaking.
- **Integration**:
  - All microservices are integrated into the service mesh to handle cross-service communication.
  - **Features**: Traffic control, security policies (mutual TLS), and monitoring of inter-service communication.

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture

**Purpose**: Enable asynchronous communication between services using events, leading to decoupling and better scalability.
- **Technology**:
  - **Apache Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for message queuing.
  - **Why**: Kafka is excellent for real-time data processing, while RabbitMQ is simpler for traditional message queuing. Both enable event-driven communication between microservices.
- **Integration**:
  - Services publish and subscribe to events via the message broker.
  - Examples: Transaction Service publishes an event when a transaction is entered, and the Valuation Service subscribes to it for real-time portfolio updates.

## Foundations for Future Features

### 1. Gamification

**Purpose**: Enhance user engagement by incorporating game-like elements.
- **Technology**:
  - **Frontend**: React.js for UI components that represent achievements, levels, and rewards.
  - **Backend**: Python or Node.js services to manage user achievements, points, and leaderboards.
- **Integration**:
  - **Gamification Service**: A dedicated microservice that tracks user activity and assigns points, badges, or levels.
  - **Event-driven triggers**: Utilize Kafka or RabbitMQ to trigger gamification events (e.g., completing a transaction earns points).

### 2. Execution of Transactions

**Purpose**: Allow users to execute financial transactions directly from the platform.
- **Technology**:
  - Integration with third-party APIs: Plaid for banking transactions, Alpaca for stock trading.
  - **Backend**: Secure transaction service built with Go or Java to handle high performance and security.
- **Integration**:
  - Transaction Execution Service: Integrated with financial institutions via secure APIs.
  - **API Gateway**: Routes execution requests to the appropriate service, ensuring secure handling.

### 3. Algorithmic Trader

**Purpose**: Provide users with automated trading capabilities based on predefined strategies.
- **Technology**:
  - **Python**: For developing trading algorithms, using libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
  - **Backend Service**: A dedicated microservice to run and manage trading bots.
- **Integration**:
  - **Algo Trading Service**: Manages trading strategies and interacts with the Execution Service to place trades.
  - **Real-time Data Feeds**: Integrated with the Valuation Service to provide up-to-date market data.

### 4. Seamless Brokerage/Banking Secure Integration

**Purpose**: Allow users to seamlessly integrate their brokerage and banking accounts with the platform.
- **Technology**:
  - **OAuth2** and **Open Banking APIs**: For secure account integration.
  - **Backend Service**: Built in Java for secure handling of banking and brokerage data.
- **Integration**:
  - **Integration Service**: Manages secure connections with external financial institutions.
  - **Encrypted Storage**: Securely stores credentials and sensitive data, potentially using **HashiCorp Vault**.

### 5. Big User Data Analytics

**Purpose**: Analyze large volumes of user data for insights and personalized recommendations.
- **Technology**:
  - **Apache Spark**: For big data processing.
  - **Python**: For data analysis and machine learning model development.
  - **Data Lake**: AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for storing large datasets.
- **Integration**:
  - **Analytics Service**: Processes user data to generate insights.
  - **Event-Driven Architecture**: Captures and analyzes user behavior events in real-time.

### 6. AI Financial Advisor

**Purpose**: Offer users personalized financial advice using AI.
- **Technology**:
  - **Python**: For developing machine learning models using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
  - **NLP Libraries**: Such as spaCy or BERT for understanding and generating natural language financial advice.
- **Integration**:
  - **AI Advisor Service**: A microservice that integrates with user data analytics to offer personalized advice.
  - **Front-End Component**: A chatbot or recommendation engine that interacts with the user.
